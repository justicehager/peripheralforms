# "We Should Be Allowed to Think" - Exhibition Design Specification

## Overview

This document provides the complete visual and aesthetic direction for the "We Should Be Allowed to Think" exhibition. It is written for Claude Code implementation and should be treated as the authoritative design guide.

The exhibition follows a three-phase aesthetic arc:

1. **Seductive Social App** (Initial state)
2. **Anxious Escalation** (As mechanisms are solved)
3. **Liberated Digital Garden** (Final state + artwork pages)

---

## Phase 1: Seductive Social App Aesthetic

### Overall Visual Character

The exhibition entrance and main mechanism interface should feel like a **highly polished, maximalist social media app** optimized for user engagement—specifically drawing from **TikTok's design language with slightly spammy elements**.

The goal is genuine seduction. Visitors should *want* to engage, interact, and solve mechanisms. The interface should feel sleek, responsive, and rewarding.

### Visual Noise Strategy

The primary vehicle for "spamminess" and maximalism is **visual noise through notification badges and alerts that appear and disappear**.

**Implementation:**
- Notification badges that float in and out of view
- Alerts that pulse, fade, and trigger
- Floating CTAs (call-to-action elements)
- Decorative overlays that feel "designed" but excessive
- Micro-animations on interactive elements
- Background elements that create visual busyness without chaos

These elements should feel:
- **Excessive but intentional** (not accidental)
- **Attention-seeking** (this is the point)
- **Rewarding** (interactions feel good, responsive)
- **Slightly pushy** (FOMO-inducing copy, urgency language)

### Color Palette

Use a **bright, energetic palette** reminiscent of TikTok or modern engagement-maximized apps:
- Primary accent colors: vibrant purples, pinks, bright blues, neons
- High contrast backgrounds (dark or very light)
- Gradients that feel dynamic and modern
- Color should feel contemporary and attention-grabbing

Consider:
- Bold, saturated colors
- Smooth gradients between complementary hues
- Strategic use of white/light space to make colors pop
- Neon or glow effects on interactive elements

### Typography

- **Sans-serif dominant** (modern, legible at all sizes)
- **Variable font weights** for visual hierarchy
- **Slightly aggressive sizing** (headlines are BIG, body text is comfortable but not cramped)
- Copy should feel conversational and slightly pushy ("Don't miss out!", "You're almost there!", etc.)

### Interactive Elements

All clickable/interactive elements should:
- Have clear hover states with visual feedback (color shift, scale change, glow)
- Animate on interaction (buttons shouldn't feel static)
- Provide immediate feedback (haptic if on mobile)
- Use micro-interactions (ripples, bounces, fades)

### Layout Strategy

- **Maximalist composition** (elements layered, overlapping where appropriate)
- **Full viewport usage** (content should feel abundant, not sparse)
- **Strategic whitespace** (used to highlight important elements, not to calm the layout)
- **Responsive but dense** (mobile should feel busy but usable, desktop should feel abundant)

## Phase 2: Anxious Escalation (Mechanism Intensification)

### Visual Transformation

As visitors solve mechanisms and progress through the exhibition, the social app aesthetic should **escalate from seductive to stressful and anxiety-inducing**.

The mechanism gradients themselves are the primary vehicle for this shift.

### Gradient Mechanisms (Existing Architecture)

**Current state:** Mechanisms appear as gradients.

**Evolution required:**
- Gradients should become more chaotic and stress-inducing
- Colors should shift toward unsettling combinations (discordant hues, high-contrast clashes)
- Animation speed should increase (faster pulsing, quicker transitions)
- Visual noise should become *more prominent*, not less
- The overall feeling should be "this is closing in on me"

**Implementation approach:**
- Early mechanisms: warm, inviting gradients (purples, pinks, blues)
- Middle mechanisms: unstable gradients (rapid color shifts, jarring hue changes)
- Late mechanisms: oppressive gradients (dark, saturated, almost nauseating color combinations)

The gradient evolution should parallel the conceptual arc: from engagement trap to awareness of entrapment.

### Notification Badges & Alerts (Intensified)

As mechanisms are solved:
- Badges should appear more frequently
- Alerts should feel more urgent
- Copy should become more pushy/manipulative
- Visual feedback should become more aggressive
- The overall "noise" should feel claustrophobic rather than exciting

Example progression:
- Early: "You're doing great!" (positive, encouraging)
- Middle: "Don't stop now!", "Time is running out!" (pressure, urgency)
- Late: "We're watching", "Your data is being collected" (threatening, revealing the surveillance apparatus)

### Color Shift

Colors should shift toward:
- Darker, more saturated tones
- Discordant combinations
- High-contrast elements that clash
- Occasional "glitchy" color artifacts
- Hints of surveillance/data visualization aesthetics (bright lines on dark, terminal-like elements)

### Accessibility Note

This escalation should never cross into genuinely harmful (flashing, seizure-inducing patterns). The stress should be psychological, not physiological.

## Phase 3: Liberated Digital Garden Aesthetic

### Overall Visual Character

When all mechanisms are solved, the exhibition transforms entirely. The social app dissolves and becomes a **digital garden / Neocities / early internet aesthetic**.

This is the "people's internet"—highly personalized, idiosyncratic, expressive chaos. Think:
- Early 2000s personal websites
- Neocities aesthetic
- Digital gardens and personal blogs
- Weird internet culture
- Hand-coded, visible construction

### Visual Character

- **Idiosyncratic chaos** (not attention-seeking, but expressive)
- **Less designed, more personal** (visible HTML/CSS structure, quirky choices)
- **Honest construction** (you can see how it's built)
- **Individual style over universal design system**
- **Playful, weird, intentionally imperfect**

### Color Palette

- **Varied, non-cohesive colors** (each section has its own palette)
- **Retro web colors** (web-safe color palette, potentially deliberate color clashing)
- **Visible color choices** (colors feel chosen for personal taste, not optimization)
- **Potentially "bad taste"** in a good way (hot pink next to lime green, etc.)

### Typography

- **Mix of serif and sans-serif**
- **Variable sizing that feels playful, not hierarchical**
- **Custom fonts or web fonts with personality** (not optimized for readability)
- **Visible font choices** (Comic Sans, Georgia, decorative fonts)
- **All-caps headers, decorative dingbats, emoji use**

### Layout Strategy

- **Non-grid layout** (floated elements, absolute positioning where appropriate)
- **Visible construction** (borders, background colors that show structure)
- **Overlapping elements** (intentional stacking, not clean separation)
- **Responsive but quirky** (doesn't necessarily scale smoothly, but adapts)
- **Visible code comments in rendered output** (optional but on-brand)

### Interactive Elements

- **Simple, visible interactions** (no fancy animations, basic hover states)
- **Links styled obviously** (underlined, color-changed)
- **Buttons that look hand-made** (borders, shadows, 3D effects)
- **Form elements that show their construction**

### Feeling

The overall aesthetic should evoke:
- Personal autonomy and ownership
- DIY culture
- Resistance to corporate design systems
- Celebration of idiosyncrasy
- Freedom from optimization
- Honesty about construction

## Artwork Pages: Artist-Sovereign Aesthetic

### Philosophy

Once a visitor has solved a mechanism and accessed an artwork, they enter a **distinct aesthetic space designed around that specific artist's work and vision**.

The artwork page is **not part of the exhibition's control system**. It's a window into the artist's practice, independent of the mechanisms that trapped it.

Each artwork page should:
- Reflect the **aesthetic and conceptual world of the artist's practice**
- Have **visual sovereignty** (not bound by exhibition design system)
- Present the work **in its own context**, not the exhibition's
- Feel like **entering a distinct space**, not scrolling the same interface

### Design Approach

For each artwork page:

1. **Research the artist's aesthetic** (existing portfolio, visual language, medium)
2. **Design a micro-site** that reflects their practice
3. **Create visual coherence within that page** (but it need not match other artwork pages)
4. **Present the work itself as the centerpiece** (not the interface)
5. **Include artist statement, context, and materials** in a design that feels integral to the work

### Practical Guidelines

**Color:** Each page can have its own palette. Consider:
- Colors from the artist's existing work
- Colors that evoke the conceptual content
- Intentional color choices that feel personal

**Typography:** Each page can use different typefaces. Consider:
- Typefaces that feel appropriate to the work
- Legibility as a requirement, personality as a choice
- Hierarchy that serves understanding, not engagement

**Layout:** Each page can have distinct structure. Consider:
- How to present the specific medium (poetry, video, images, interactive elements)
- Spatial relationships that enhance understanding
- Responsiveness that doesn't sacrifice design intent

**Interaction:** Minimal, purposeful. Consider:
- What interactions serve the work (not the exhibition)
- Simple navigation back to the main exhibition
- Presentation that foregrounds the artwork itself

### General Principles for All Artwork Pages

- **The artwork is the protagonist** (interface is supporting)
- **Clarity over cleverness** (the work should be accessible)
- **Aesthetics serve meaning** (design choices support conceptual content)
- **Artist sovereignty** (page can break exhibition rules if the work demands it)

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Complete the Seductive Social App
1. Establish color palette and typography system
2. Implement notification badge system (appearing/disappearing alerts)
3. Add micro-interactions to all interactive elements
4. Create visual noise through floating elements and overlays
5. Ensure seductive, engagement-optimized feeling throughout

### Phase 2: Escalate Mechanisms
1. Evolve gradient mechanisms from seductive → anxious
2. Intensify notification badges and alerts as mechanisms are solved
3. Shift color palette toward unsettling combinations
4. Increase animation speed and visual busyness
5. Add subtle "surveillance reveal" elements (showing backend infrastructure)

### Phase 3: Design Liberated State
1. Create digital garden landing page (visible when all mechanisms solved)
2. Design Neocities-inspired layout and aesthetic
3. Implement quirky, idiosyncratic typography and color
4. Build navigation to artwork pages
5. Ensure feeling of freedom and personal expression

### Phase 4: Artwork Pages
1. Design distinct micro-site for each of the 5 artists
2. Reflect each artist's aesthetic and conceptual world
3. Present artworks as centerpieces
4. Include artist context and statements
5. Ensure seamless navigation back to main exhibition

## Technical Considerations

### CSS Architecture

Build a system that supports:
- **Phase 1 colors and variables** (seductive social app)
- **Phase 2 color overrides** (anxiety escalation)
- **Phase 3 completely different system** (digital garden)
- **Artwork page isolation** (each page can override/ignore exhibition system)

Use CSS custom properties (variables) for:
- Phase 1: primary palette, notification colors, accent colors
- Phase 2: anxiety palette, stress colors, glitch effects
- Phase 3: digital garden palette (multiple variations)

### State Management

The exhibition state (number of mechanisms solved) should drive:
- Visual intensity and noise level
- Color palette shifts
- Gradient mechanism evolution
- Visibility of infrastructure components

Smooth transitions between phases where appropriate; abrupt shifts where they serve the experience.

### Responsive Design

Maintain the aesthetic across:
- Desktop (abundant, noisy, full-featured)
- Tablet (dense but usable)
- Mobile (maximalist but legible)

The seductive quality should work at all sizes.

## Tone & Copy Strategy

### Phase 1: Seductive (Social App)
- Encouraging, positive, slightly pushy
- FOMO language ("Don't miss out!", "See what others are solving!")
- Reward language ("You're doing great!", "One more to go!")
- Social proof ("Join the exhibition", "See who's solved this")

### Phase 2: Anxious (Escalation)
- Pressure and urgency ("Time's running out!", "Solve before it's too late")
- Threat and control ("We're watching your progress", "Your data is being collected")
- Discomfort ("Are you sure?", "This might be uncomfortable")
- Awareness ("Notice how this feels?", "What are you trading for access?")

### Phase 3: Liberated (Digital Garden)
- Personal, idiosyncratic, welcoming
- Invitation rather than pressure ("Come explore", "See what's here")
- Celebration of agency ("You did it", "Welcome to the liberated space")
- Curiosity-driven ("What do you want to learn?", "Discover at your own pace")

## Final Notes

The exhibition's visual journey mirrors its conceptual arc: from seductive engagement trap → anxious awareness of control → liberated personal expression.

Each phase should feel visually *different enough* to signal transformation, but connected enough to feel like a continuous journey.

Artwork pages exist outside this arc—they're spaces of artistic sovereignty, freed from the exhibition's control systems.

The overall effect should be: **this is what engagement maximization feels like, here's what it does to you, and here's what freedom looks like.**
