          <p>
            This exhibition is part of Fall of Freedom, a nationwide movement of 600+ creative actions taking place November 21-22, 2025, uniting artists, galleries, theaters, and cultural spaces in defiance of authoritarian forces sweeping the nation. When the call went out, I felt compelled to bring Peripheral Forms back from dormancy to participate—because this work demands to exist now, in this moment, as part of this collective resistance.

          <h2>What's happening here</h2>
          <p>
            The most dangerous thing about authoritarianism isn't what it silences—it's what it makes unthinkable in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            This exhibition explores pre-emptive control: how contemporary power operates not by censoring what you say, but by engineering what you can think before thought even forms. Through predetermined narratives, imposed naming, attention infrastructure, and compulsory performance, authoritarian systems—governmental and algorithmic alike—shape consciousness at its source.
          </p>
          <p>
            Six artworks respond with different tactics: hacking imposed names back to their truth, testifying against predetermined narratives, creating inner space under surveillance, withdrawing from compulsory visibility, and exposing the "groveling" required by digital systems. But you can't see them yet.

          <h2>How this works</h2>
          <p>
            Each artwork is trapped behind the same mechanisms that capture your attention every day: infinite scroll that removes natural stopping points, autoplay countdowns that pressure you forward, CAPTCHAs that demand you prove you're human, interfaces that shame you into compliance, systems that normalize being watched.
          </p>
          <p>
            These mechanisms don't just annoy you. They condition you to obey in advance—to accept the names authorities impose, to internalize their narratives, to perform on demand, to trade privacy for access. The panopticon evolved: you don't need guards when the infrastructure itself engineers compliance before you realize you wanted to resist.
          </p>
          <p>
            To access each artwork, you must actively solve the mechanism trapping it. Not disable it with a click—solve it like a puzzle. Break through the content layer it uses to justify itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you solve more mechanisms, the platform's surveillance infrastructure becomes visible. What looks like a normal website progressively reveals what's always there—the tracking, the monitoring, the apparatus that makes pre-emptive obedience possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solve all six, and the platform collapses into something else entirely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start anywhere. There's no required order. The art is waiting behind the mechanisms.
