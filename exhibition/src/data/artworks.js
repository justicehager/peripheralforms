    description: 'The work is a Chrome browser extension that renames the Gulf of America to the Gulf of Mexico. Its aim is to counter the authoritarian government of U.S. president Donald Trump, its objective of a culture of control that extends out of the U.S. and has global impact, and is supported by U.S. corporate power.',
    artistStatement: `In 2025 U.S. president Donald Trump signed executive order 14172, Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness. The order contained two sections instructing federal agencies to rename two natural landmarks: section 3 ordering the name of Denali, the highest mountain in North America named by the Koyukon people who inhabit the area of Alaska around the mountain and have referred to the peak as Denali for centuries, to be renamed Mount McKinley; and section 4 ordering the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico, which refers to the ethnonym Mexica and the Nahuatl-speaking people or Aztecs of the Valley of Mexico, as the Gulf of America.

The executive order is not binding on U.S. state governments or the private sector. It simply directs federal agencies to employ the new names. On February 10th 2025, Google, the American corporation, choose to change the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on Google Maps. This Google Chrome extension subverts Google's own browser extension system to correct this change. It intervenes in Google Maps, masks the new name with the original and rightful name of the Gulf of Mexico, correcting the imperialistic action taken by the U.S. president and validated by corporate power. The work/extension is named to 'grate', to aggravate and exasperate, the alleged "American Greatness" that president Trump aims to honor.`,
    thematicStatement: `Order 14172 changes natural landmark names that acknowledge indigenous cultures, in existence long before the establishment of the U.S., and are used in a global context. It is the action of a culture of control. The renaming of the Gulf of Mexico is especially problematic as it is shared by three countries: the U.S., Mexico and Cuba. The work, Restoring a Name to Grate American Honor, takes direct control of Google's own system/tools to hack and subvert its maps and deny the implementation of the name change. It is a counter action against U.S. government and corporate power's suppression of thought and identity, reclaiming both a mental space and a geographical place.`,

    description: 'I am submitting a poem I wrote in response to a confrontation with the police in 2023 that I find resonant now. I have included a brif statement about the history of this writing on the page following the poem.',
    artistStatement: `My work touches on a myriad themes including activism and social discourse, often seeking to draw attention to and confront things happening in the world around me. I work in a huge range of media and have recently found myself writing more as a means of connecting with wider audiences. I have been represented in things curated through peripheral forms long before, but not so much in recent history, and I would like to join in doing so again. The Fall of Freedom initiative is very much needed and I am grateful that you are doing something for this.`,
    thematicStatement: `My writing is specifically about an interrogation by the police in which I felt like they were trying to make me admit to something which I didn't do - they already had the narrative well in place that they wanted to present and it didn't matter what I said, they acted as though they would not be swayed from their perceived outcome. It was anxiety-inducing to say the least, and the poem evolved out of this interaction to convey that sense of helplessness. I find it even more relevant now.`,

    description: 'Isolation procedures: this the new normal, built on repression, digital surveillance, the closure of public spaces, the censorship of commentary. We see the distancing of individuals with descent into drugs and disrepair, the enforced loss of voice. The remnants of the natural world can only look on.',
    artistStatement: `I am a poet and video artist with a life-long background in science. Much of my work incorporates the language and concepts of science into critiques of the impacts o humans on the world and each other. This video came out of responses to the COVID-19 epidemic, but engages with larger themes of how individuals experience the propaganda of authority.`,
    thematicStatement: `The work used advanced video compositing methods and digital audio production to create the imagined inner space of an individual finding their way through an authoritarian environment that seeks to homogenise and restrict their lived experience. In the end, after the credits, we are reminded that the natural world can provide us with a way out, if only we give it a chance.`,

    thematicStatement: `The first image (DE-1) appears in my ongoing graduate research into CAPTCHAs as a human computation system where our data labeling work is both mysterious and unimportant. The other two images (DE-2, 3) respond more specifically to the broader technofascist`,

    description: 'a selection from a selection of collectively made digital art images of free expression',
    artistStatement: `we work together via a private telegram group where all participants can add and remix images from the chat, a selection of this flowing process is being released two times per year, the credit gets shared in the selection but all participants can have participated in each image, the credit is less important than the final artworks, together we can make things a single mind can't imagine and we inspire eachother and communicate through the fun of making art`,
    thematicStatement: `it probably doesn't (or not) (double negation intended)

most of the work doesn't get published anywhere, the current theme of the collaborative process is "perfect unpublished"

in the privacy of a private chat self censorship isn't required, neither is the need to be internet famous for clicks and likes

the revolution will not be pixelized`,

    description: 'These searches attempt to find tools, APIs, or documentation for infrastructure that would expose how search algorithms pre-shape consciousness. Each query triggers a different mechanism of algorithmic control. The searches are both artwork and evidence—generating phantom demand for cognitive liberation tools while documenting why such tools cannot exist within the systems that would need to provide them.',
    thematicStatement: 'The searches demonstrate how platforms admit control mechanisms through their own correction systems. Results vary based on personalization settings, showing that control mechanisms adapt to each user while maintaining the same underlying structure. Instructions are provided for others to perform these searches themselves.',
